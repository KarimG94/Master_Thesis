# modify proteome fasta headers as well to be fitting to gff3 names. Note that for PS1579.HapB, the chromosome 2 gene names are g123_ps1579_c_t1 and vice versa for HapC. This was done as the chromosomes were at first mixed up between haplotypes, error was found with mash dist.

# cat all .blast file together to xyz.blast and all .gff3 files together to xyz.gff, put in one folder, then use MCScanX:

# put xyz.collinearity file, gff file and color_file (colors from nigon element file) into Synvisio
